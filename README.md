# KBase UI Plugin: Taxonomy Support

> View taxons and navigation within a taxonomy

This is a plugin for [kbase-ui](https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui), which allows a KBase user to view individual taxons, and navigate within the taxonomy to which that taxon belongs.

The canonical home for it is https://narrative.kbase.us#taxonomy.

Currently the Taxonomy plugin supports [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy),  [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org), and [RDP](https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp) taxonomies.
